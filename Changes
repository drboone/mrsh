   - hooray, I got the host routing stuff to actually work.  I proved it out on
     a test, but it wasn't terribly convincing.  Then I used this:
       mrsh -H 'corky!wisp!corky!razor!webserver' 'touch /tmp/holy\ shit'
     The escapes for that are tricky to get right, but it *is* possible.

   - added all kinds of bells and whistles (ok, bugfixes)
   - made the t/05 meaningful
   - convinced MrShell to allow commands with various subst vars
   - made the t/05 test *portable*, rather than using external linux commands

   - This is practically a finished product.
   - It works on multiple hosts.
   - There are tests.
   - There's logging.
   - There's config files...
   + it still lacks host+host routing and
   + documentation

   - got this more or less working, building some tests
